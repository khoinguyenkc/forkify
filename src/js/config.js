export const proxy = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/';
 //our api doesnt have a problem with using a different domain to access whatever, s owe dont need to use cors, but we'll do it for practie purposes

//if we had a key we'll store it here too
//that's not realistic because this isprivate data, should not be stored in client side
//he said ideally store in ajax call api something... idk
